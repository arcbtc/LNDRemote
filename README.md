# LNDRemote

Using an ESP32 and Epaper, we are able to connect to our LND node and output its info on the Epaper display. Having an air-gap between your node, means you don't need to expose it to check its functioning properly. It also means you can keep an eye on the node from another location

The module checks the node every 1min then goes to sleep
